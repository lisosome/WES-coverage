# WES-coverage
Simple R script to normalise coverage of desired samples using a baseline of healthy samples and compare them visually.

Takes as input regions bed files created by mosdepth (https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth).

This code has been used to generate Figure 17 of my PhD dissertation thesis.
